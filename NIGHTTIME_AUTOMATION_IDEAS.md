# Nighttime Automation Ideas for KimiKupu

This document outlines potential automated tasks that could be worked on during off-hours to maximize development efficiency and token usage.

## Language & Content Expansion

### Word List Development
- Research and compile word lists for additional Polynesian languages (Samoan, Fijian, Hawaiian, Cook Islands Māori)
- Cross-validate existing word definitions for accuracy and cultural appropriateness
- Create themed word collections (nature, family, colors, etc.) for each language
- Verify word length consistency across languages for game balance

### Cultural & Educational Content
- Generate pronunciation guides using International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) notation
- Create cultural context notes for words with special significance or traditional meanings
- Develop etymology information linking related words across Polynesian languages
- Research and document regional variations in word usage

## Performance & SEO Optimization

### Technical Analysis
- Comprehensive bundle size analysis and code splitting recommendations
- Lighthouse audits with detailed improvement plans for performance, accessibility, SEO
- Core Web Vitals optimization strategies
- Progressive Web App (PWA) enhancement suggestions

### Search & Discovery
- Meta tag optimization for each language variant
- Open Graph and Twitter Card implementations for social sharing
- Structured data markup for search engines
- Multi-language sitemap generation strategies

### Offline Capabilities
- Service worker implementation for offline gameplay
- Cache strategies for word lists and definitions
- Offline statistics persistence
- Background sync for when connection returns

## Advanced Feature Development

### Game Mechanics
- Daily challenge system with persistent cross-language scoring
- Hint system with graduated difficulty levels (letter position, vowel/consonant, definition clues)
- Streak tracking across multiple languages
- Achievement system for language learning milestones

### User Experience
- Statistics tracking and visualization across multiple languages
- Social sharing with language-specific formatting and cultural elements
- Custom difficulty modes (word length variations, time challenges)
- Tutorial system for new players unfamiliar with Polynesian languages

### Accessibility Features
- Screen reader optimization for visually impaired users
- High contrast mode implementation
- Keyboard-only navigation improvements
- Audio pronunciation feature integration

## Code Architecture Improvements

### Type Safety & Quality
- TypeScript strict mode migration with comprehensive type definitions
- ESLint rule optimization for consistency and best practices
- Component prop validation and documentation
- Error boundary implementation with user-friendly fallbacks

### Testing & Reliability
- Comprehensive unit test suite for all game logic
- Integration tests for multi-language functionality
- End-to-end testing scenarios for critical user paths
- Performance regression testing automation

### Documentation & Maintenance
- Component library documentation with Storybook integration
- API documentation for data structures and game state
- Contribution guidelines for community word list additions
- Deployment and maintenance runbooks

## Analytics & User Experience Research

### Data-Driven Improvements
- User journey analysis and optimization suggestions
- A/B testing infrastructure for UI/UX improvements
- Conversion funnel analysis (visitor → player → repeat player)
- Language preference and difficulty analysis

### Mobile & Cross-Platform
- Mobile-first responsive design comprehensive review
- Touch interaction optimization for gesture-based inputs
- Cross-browser compatibility testing and fixes
- App store optimization research for potential mobile apps

### Internationalization
- Right-to-left language support infrastructure (future-proofing)
- Number and date localization for statistics
- Cultural color and design sensitivity review
- Multi-language error message systems

## Implementation Priority Suggestions

### High Impact, Low Risk
1. Word list expansion and validation
2. Performance optimization analysis
3. Accessibility improvements
4. Documentation generation

### Medium Impact, Medium Risk
1. Hint system development
2. Daily challenge infrastructure
3. Advanced statistics tracking
4. PWA implementation

### High Impact, Higher Risk
1. Multi-language architecture overhaul
2. Real-time multiplayer features
3. Machine learning for adaptive difficulty
4. Community-driven content management

## Notes for Implementation

- Each task should be well-defined and self-contained
- Focus on areas that don't require real-time user feedback
- Prioritize improvements that enhance the core language learning experience
- Consider cultural sensitivity in all language-related enhancements
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing game saves and statistics
